//Multiple Answers:

     What two people are entombed in Grant's tomb? {

//Note that there is no equal sign (=) in any answer and the answers should total no more than 100%, otherwise Moodle will return an error. To avoid the problem of students automatically getting 100% by simply checking all of the answers, it is best to include negative answer weights for wrong answers.

//Special Characters ~ = # { } :
//These symbols ~ = # { } control the operation of this filter 
//and cannot be used as normal text within questions. 
//Since these symbols have a special role in determining the 
//operation of this filter, they are called "control characters." 
//But sometimes you may want to use one of these characters, 
//for example to show a mathematical formula in a question. 
//The way to get around this problem is "escaping" the control characters.
//This means simply putting a backslash (\) before a control character 
//so the filter will know that you want to use it as a literal character 
//instead of as a control character. For example:

     Which answer equals 5? {
          ~ \= 2 + 2
          = \= 2 + 3
          ~ \= 2 + 4  }

     ::GIFT Control Characters::
     Which of the following is NOT a control character for the GIFT import format? {
        ~ \~     # \~ is a control character.
        ~ \=     # \= is a control character.
        ~ \#     # \# is a control character.
        ~ \{     # \{ is a control character.
        ~ \}     # \} is a control character.
        = \     # Correct! \ (backslash) is not a control character. BUT,
                   it is used to escape the control characters.
     }
